1. Database Configuration for Hanko is provided through a yaml file `hanko-config.yaml`. Either crreate this file in an `initContainer` using the database credentials secrets or store the entire file in Vault.
2. Hanko does not seem to work with self signed certificates generated by Traefik. This prevents Hanko working on localhost as I cannot create real certificates for the starter.com domain.
